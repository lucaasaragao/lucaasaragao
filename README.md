### What I'm working on 👨‍💻

I am currently working on development and support of applications in JAVA using the SpringBoot framework with an emphasis on reactive programming using WEBFLUX. In addition, I have some personal projects where I use other languages and frameworks. If you want to get to know me better, visit my portal. [click here](http://lucaas.com.br/) 😄
